# Predicting User Engagement with Logistic Regression

In this project, I attempt to predict player engagement using logistic regression. 
We have a dataset with gameplay sessions.
I explore and preprocess the data using various statistical tools.
Then, I use feature engineering to create a user vector.
I then fit a logistic regression model on the train set.
I evaluate and interpret the model results.
The trained model obtains an overall accuracy of 74% on the test set.
Finally, I conduct hyperparameter finetuning to find the best parameters.
