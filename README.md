# Predicting User Engagement with Logistic Regression

In this project, I predicted player engagement using logistic regression. 
We have a dataset with gameplay sessions.
I explored and preprocessed the data using various statistical tools.
Then, I used feature engineering to create a user vector.
I then fitted a logistic regression model on the train set.
I evaluated and interpreted the model results.
The trained model obtains an overall accuracy of 74% on the test set.
Finally, I conducted hyperparameter finetuning to find the best parameters.
